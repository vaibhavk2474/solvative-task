# React Interview Questions

## 1. How can we avoid memory leaks in our React JS application?
To avoid memory leaks in a React JS application, follow these best practices:
- **Clean up subscriptions**: Use `useEffect` cleanup functions to unsubscribe from subscriptions, timers, or any asynchronous tasks.
- **Avoid stale state**: Ensure you do not hold onto outdated state or props in asynchronous calls.
- **Proper component unmounting**: Clean up any resources in `componentWillUnmount` in class components or the cleanup function in `useEffect` for functional components.
- **Avoid excessive use of refs**: Only use refs when necessary and clean up any DOM references properly.

## 2. How do you decide to choose Redux and Context API in your project?
When deciding between Redux and the Context API, consider:
- **Complexity**: Use Redux for complex state management where many components need to access and modify the state.
- **Middleware**: Redux is preferable if you need middleware to handle side effects, such as asynchronous actions.
- **DevTools**: Redux offers powerful developer tools for debugging.
- **Simplicity**: Use Context API for simpler state needs, like theming or user authentication, where you don't need the full power of Redux.

## 3. How can you add a feature theme to your application without much re-rendering of your app?
To add a theme feature without causing significant re-renders:
- **Use Context API**: Create a context for the theme and wrap your app with a provider.
- **Memoize Context Value**: Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the theme changes.
- **Optimize Components**: Use `React.memo` for components consuming the theme context to avoid re-renders unless necessary.
- **Conditional Context Usage**: Only use context where needed to minimize re-renders.

## 4. What should I answer when the interviewer asks about the hardest issue you faced and how you debugged it?
Example answer:
"One of the hardest issues I faced was intermittent crashes in a React application. It was challenging due to its sporadic nature. I debugged it by:
1. **Reproducing the Issue**: Collaborated with QA to identify a reproducible sequence.
2. **Analyzing Logs**: Checked logs for patterns indicating a memory leak.
3. **Profiling the App**: Used Chrome DevTools to profile memory usage.
4. **Code Review**: Found and fixed improper cleanup of resources in components.
5. **Testing**: Conducted extensive tests to ensure stability.
This experience taught me the importance of proper resource management and systematic debugging."

## 5. How can we use side effects in React JS?
To handle side effects in React:
- **useEffect Hook**: Use `useEffect` to perform side effects such as data fetching or manual DOM manipulation.
- **Dependency Array**: Control when the effect runs by specifying dependencies.
- **Cleanup Function**: Return a cleanup function in `useEffect` to clean up resources, preventing memory leaks.
- **Conditional Side Effects**: Run effects conditionally based on state or props.
